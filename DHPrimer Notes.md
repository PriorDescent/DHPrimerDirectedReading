-Successfully installed Tangent using the Dropbox link provided by Professor Graham.

-Tangent Version: 1.2.2 (build .8)

-Current System Information:

	-OS: Windows 10 Home

	-Version: 10.0.19045

	-Build: 19045

-The installation process was straightforward, with no issues or compatibility warnings.

-Initial tests show Tangent is running smoothly on this system.

-Next Step: Plan to install Tangent on my laptop (running Windows 11) to compare performance and user experience across operating systems and ensure compatibility for cross-platform use.

-Began familiarizing myself with Tangent's interface and toolset:

-Exploring the folder and workspace system, including how files and notes are organized.

-Testing note-taking features, tagging, and project structures to understand best practices for workflow integration.

-Assessing Tangent's potential as a daily research and writing environment.

	-So far, the user interface appears intuitive, though some features require deeper exploration to understand their full capabilities.

-Met with Professor Graham and group members to discuss ongoing progress and project planning.

-As a team, we’ve decided to use Trello as our primary tool for task management and progress tracking. A shared Trello board has been created with categories for to-do, in-progress, and completed tasks. 
	
	-Each group member is responsible for updating their respective tasks as the project evolves.

-My primary role in the project will be the development of a short instructional or “how-to” video that demonstrates a key technical process (likely related to Tangent installation or usage).

-I will be using PowerDirector 365 (PD365) by Cyberlink for this task, as it includes both video editing tools and a built-in screen capture utility.

-Installed PD365 and verified that the screen recording feature is functional.

-I have not previously edited screen-recorded footage, so I will be documenting my learning process with both the capture and editing workflows, possibly for inclusion in the final report or a supplementary reflection.

-I aim to create a 1-minute video that is:

	- Simple and clear, minimizing visual clutter and extraneous information.

	- Designed with accessibility in mind — both in terms of who can engage with the video (e.g., new users, neurodiverse learners, etc.) and how the information is presented (slow pacing, clean visuals, clear narration or captions).

	- Highly focused, with a clear start, middle, and end that walks viewers through a single task without distractions.

	- I believe that a well-structured video can be one of the most accessible and user-friendly mediums for teaching software installation, especially for those unfamiliar with written technical documentation.

	- The challenge will be balancing clarity and thoroughness while staying within the 1-minute limit. I see this constraint as a creative opportunity — it forces brevity, intentionality, and careful script planning.

//June 2nd
- worked thorugh Beginner modules 01- 05
- 01, breif introduction to DH and python coding language
- 02, "first code". This seciton could have more information and pedagogy within it. 
	-  "In this first module, you'll go from passively reading about code to actively writing and executing it. It's time to get your hands dirty and see how a few lines of code can create real-world results right before your eyes.

This is where the magic of coding begins. You'll learn the fundamental process of running code, starting with the incredibly versatile print() command. This simple function is your first tool for communicating with the computer, allowing you to display text and see the direct output of your instructions. By the end of this section, you'll have successfully run your very first Python program. Let's dive in!

-Keep the intros breif, summarizing, and motivating. 

//June 20th 
- worked through Beginner modules 06-10
- each one pedagogically teaches students about the Python basics. First week focuses less on Python basics, and more on coding basics.
	- what is coding? What can it do, etc?
- later weeks is more familar to me, with text analysis code and processes being demonstrated and practiced

//July 2nd
- Completed Beginner modules. 
- I find the Frankenstein-text assignment VERY valuable. This was essentially our final project in the "Coding For Digital Humanists" course I took at the Library.
- Has students use an eBook from Project Gutenberg to create a distant read and text analysis.
- It is valuable to keep the text the same for all students, however another option would be too have the students pick any text from Gutenberg since theoretically the assignment should still work with some adjustments. 

//July 8th
- Began intermediate modules. I realize that this is where my coding knowledge runs thin.
- A lot of the terminology is familiar, such as Pandas for Data Manipulation, NLTK, and Web Scraping.
- However, I get lost towards the end of DH Intermediate, particularly the JSON handling and pagination. With that being said, I was able to work through the assignment of Exploring Chronicling America. I think this assessment is valuable, expecially in a history course.

//August 6th
- HUGE change to the project: no longer using Tangent as a platform
- Professor Shawn Graham decided to switch to an online website-based platform
- I think this is a better choice since it would not require the student to download any additional applications. 
- Working on introductions for the new online-based course.

//August 10th
- Attempting to finish the Advanced folder in the DHPrimer tangent application.
- Unfortunately, this coding is much above my skill level
- With that being said, I find some personal value in understanding how coding can be used in the analysis of not only text, number, or documents. But Visual and audio as well.
- I find the accessibility factor of data sonification also VERY interesting. 
- It would be very valuable to have a meeting to see where everybody is and what direction we are moving

//August 20th
- Working through the week's modules in order. starting with the Beginner folder.
 
 **Working With Course Files**
Files in the lab bench include:
	-Notes and readings in .md format

	-Python notebooks in .ipynb format

	-Use markdown for reflective notes and reading observations

	-Use code cells for analysis or exercises

-First Assignments
	-Explore preloaded materials (notebooks and markdown notes)

-Create two files:

	-A Reflection Note: Describe your experience, difficulties, discoveries, or questions.

-A Week 1 Memo Note: Summary of what you did/learned this week.

-Download these notes by right-clicking in the file pane > Download

-Upload them to your GitHub repository as part of your coursework tracking

-Learning Goals & Takeaways
	-Understand how to interact with a Python coding environment using Jupyter.

-Begin thinking in terms of digital workflows: combining computation and interpretation.

-Get familiar with using markdown and notebooks as tools for self-documenting research.

-Realize the value of reproducibility, version control, and accessible note-making in computational research.
